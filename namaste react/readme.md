## ðŸŒŸ Caret (`^`) vs Tilde (`~`) in `package.json`

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:------:|:--------|
| `^` | Allows updates that do not change the first non-zero version (e.g., `^1.2.3` â†’ accepts `1.x.x` but not `2.x.x`) |
| `~` | Allows patch-level updates only (e.g., `~1.2.3` â†’ accepts `1.2.x`, but not `1.3.x`) |

> **Tip:**  
> Use `^` for most dependencies to stay updated with minor releases.  
> Use `~` when you need tighter control over updates.

### HMR

```bash
Hot Module Reloading
```


### File Watcher Algorithm 
```bash
written in c++
```
Itâ€™s an algorithm that monitors files or folders for any changes like:

    - Created

    - Modified

    - Deleted

When a change happens â†’ it triggers an action (like rebuild, reload, etc.).
(That's how Parcel, Vite, etc. detect when you save a file.)
