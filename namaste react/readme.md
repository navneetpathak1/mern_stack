  ðŸ”¹ Great for small-to-medium projects  
  ðŸ”¹ Quick to start without heavy setup.

- **Vite**  
  A blazing-fast modern bundler.

## ðŸŒŸ Caret (`^`) vs Tilde (`~`) in `package.json`

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:------:|:--------|
| `^` | Allows updates that do not change the first non-zero version (e.g., `^1.2.3` â†’ accepts `1.x.x` but not `2.x.x`) |
| `~` | Allows patch-level updates only (e.g., `~1.2.3` â†’ accepts `1.2.x`, but not `1.3.x`) |

> **Tip:**  
> Use `^` for most dependencies to stay updated with minor releases.  
> Use `~` when you need tighter control over updates.

### HMR

```bash
Hot Module Reloading
```


### File Watcher Algorithm 
```bash
written in c++
```
Itâ€™s an algorithm that monitors files or folders for any changes like:

    - Created

    - Modified

    - Deleted

When a change happens â†’ it triggers an action (like rebuild, reload, etc.).
(That's how Parcel, Vite, etc. detect when you save a file.)


## if you want to remove your console log =>
babel-plugin-transform-remove-console
run

```bash
npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev
```
---
make .babelrc file
```bash
{
  "plugins": [ ["transform-remove-console", { "exclude": [ "error", "warn"] }] ]
}
```

babel convert 
```bash 
https://babeljs.io/
```
```bash
const heading4 = (
  <h1 key="n"> Hello world : </h1>
)
```
==>
```bash
  const heading4 = React.createElement("h1", { key: "n" }, "Hello world");
```

React Component
- Class Based Component => Old way 
- Functional => new way

## Component Composition 
```bash
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header /> // => Component Composition
            <Content />
            <Footer />

- ***Config Driven UI***
- ***Virtual Dom***
- ***Reconciliation ***
- ***React Fiber Architecture*** 



## monolithic and microservices architecture

- Monolithic: Complete project in one place all APIs, UI, Auth, DB all things are in one project only, So if need to change color of a button then again deploy all project

- Microservices: ***single responsibility principle***, ***separation of concern***

---

***So how We communicate with these different different services:***
Different different services are operate on different different port, And we communicate using these port.

there are two main approach to do so:
- 1. Loads -> API call -> Render UI
- 2. Loads -> Render -> API call -> Render  (Better)  => useEffect


In **useEffect** - if no dependency array then useEffect is called every re-render
                 - if empty dependency array then only once
                 - if some value inside dependency array then only when the value changes
