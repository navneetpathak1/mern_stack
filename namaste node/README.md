# Node.js - History and Evolution

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Below is a detailed history of how it came to life and evolved into one of the most popular platforms for server-side development.

---

## Origins and Motivation

- **2009**
  - Created by **Ryan Dahl** to address the limitations of traditional web servers that blocked during I/O operations.
  - Originally experimented with **SpiderMonkey** (Mozilla's JavaScript engine) for the first **2 days**.
  - Switched to **V8**, Google Chrome's engine, for superior performance and native machine code compilation.
  - Initially supported only **macOS** and **Linux**.

- The project was first named **web.js**, then renamed to **Node.js** to reflect broader networking capabilities.

---

## Initial Release

- **May 27, 2009**
  - First public release at the European JSConf.
  - Introduced **non-blocking I/O**, **event-driven architecture**, and **single-threaded concurrency**.

---

## NPM - Node Package Manager

- **2010**
  - **NPM** was created by **Isaac Z. Schlueter**.
  - Purpose: Simplify sharing and management of JavaScript packages.
  - Grew into the **largest software registry** in the world.

---

## Adoption and Growth

- **2011**
  - Node.js began gaining traction in the developer community.
  - Windows support started to stabilize.
  - Early adopters included **LinkedIn**, **Walmart**, and others.

- **2012–2014**
  - Community adoption exploded.
  - Popular frameworks like **Express.js** emerged.
  - Node.js was increasingly used for APIs, microservices, and real-time applications.

---

## Key Milestones

- **2014**
  - Project governance disagreements led to a fork called **io.js**.

- **2015**
  - **Node.js Foundation** was formed under the **Linux Foundation**.
  - Node.js and io.js merged back into a single project to avoid fragmentation.

- **2016–Present**
  - Regular **Long-Term Support (LTS)** releases.
  - Major improvements including:
    - `async/await`
    - **HTTP/2**
    - **ES Modules**
    - Performance optimizations
